# Pump Display MVP

## Notes

- Use bare html, css, js so it is easy to adapt to any framework (angular, react, vue, etc.)
- Start without any graphics to focus on getting the behavior working first
- Deviate from sample schema to instead use an array to represent the pumps which is the idiomatic way to represent a list in json
