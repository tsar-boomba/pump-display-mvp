# Pump Display MVP

## Notes

- Use bare html, css, js so it is easy to adapt to any framework (angular, react, vue, etc.)
- Use JSDoc for type hints
- Don't use graphics or any fancy styles to put the behavior and operation first and foremost
- Deviate from sample schema to instead use an array to represent the pumps which is the idiomatic way to represent a list in json
- Hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://tsar-boomba.github.io/pump-display-mvp/)
